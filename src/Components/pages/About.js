                      We came into existence in the year 2024 as the vision of
                      Ms. Malti. One day, she encountered children begging for
                      money, and when she spoke to them, she realized their deep
                      desire for food and education. Moved by their situation,
                      she took it upon herself to create a platform that would
                      provide them with learning opportunities and a brighter
                      future. Thus, Lotus Gyan Ganga Welfare Society was
                      foundedâ€”a registered NGO dedicated to empowering
                      underprivileged children through education and holistic
                      development. In addition to providing quality education,
                      we also ensure that these children receive nutritious
                      mid-day meals, supporting their overall well-being and
                      growth.
